    <h1>Alexander Santos Santana</h1>
    <img src="images/self.jpg" alt="Portrait of Alexander" class = "portrait">
    <p>My name is Alexander Santos and I am starting my journey as a web developer. Before coming to Digital Crafts, I spent most of my time studying Python and building PCs.
        Through my time studying Python I found a passion for writing code which led me to find a bootcamp.
        My goal is to start my career as a web developer and fully submerge myself into all things programming. 
        In my personal time, aside from studying, I build PCs, travel with my wife, and spend time with my family and two dogs. 
        Some of my interests include: Gaming, playing Football, working on japanese cars, 
        and an expensive hobby of being a sneaker head.</p>
